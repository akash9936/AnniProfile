<p>25 July 2024,</p>
<p>My Precious Anni,</p>

<p>Happy Birthday to the woman who brightens my world! 🎉💖🎂</p>

<p>I know I'm already in your heart because you love me so much, and now I want to fill your every thought too—because, let's be honest, there's plenty of room for me to take over! 😉❤️</p>

<p>You know, if you were the Titanic, you wouldn't sink like it did. Even the ice would melt at the sight of you. Your smile is so powerful and enchanting that you turn the coldest moments into warmth and the darkest days into light. Just being around you makes everything brighter and better. 🌟✨💫</p>

<p>I love how we share everything, even when we’re thousands of kilometres apart. The joy of online shopping together and recounting each incident twice—first in our minds to remember it for our calls, and then actually sharing it on the call—makes our long-distance relationship feel incredibly connected and special. 🛍️💬📞</p>

<p>You’ve been my rock even you are a rose, supporting me through all my downsides—whether it was during my busy office days, the chaos of house construction, or my appraisal cycle. Your devoted support is the heartbeat of my life and the source of my strength. 🌹💪🏽❤️</p>

<p>You’ve enriched my life in so many wonderful ways. Your kindness, the lessons you’ve taught me, and your strength inspire me daily. Your love has truly made me a better person. I’m deeply grateful for you. 🙏💖🌟</p>

<p>I miss you every day and can't wait to spend my life capturing your beautiful smile in photos. Yes, I'll gladly be your personal photographer forever. 📸💕</p>

<p>As we celebrate your birthday today, my charming chick, I can't help but dream about all the future adventures we'll embark on together. From exploring new places to cherishing memories like those we created in Raipur, I'm excited about every moment we’ll share. 🌍🗺️✨</p>

<p>Happy birthday, my love! My wish for you is a year filled with happiness, getting result of all your hard work, and endless love. May your ketu works for your wishes. 🎈🎁🌟💫</p>

<p>Loving you always,</p>

<p>Your Personal Photographer</p>

<p>Happy Valentine's Day! ❤️</p>

<p>Through this Valentine's letter, I want to express how seeing you again after two years felt like a streak I couldn't wait to end. But that moment was just as magical as the first time I saw you at the station—it was like discovering a whole new level of beauty. Maybe we need to invent a whole new language just to capture how truly stunning you are because I find myself unable to express it in any known language. ✨</p>

<p>You're my personal sunshine ☀️, brightening every moment, whether we're together or apart. Your smile is like a dazzling firework 🎆, and I find myself reaching for sunglasses. 🕶️</p>

<p>And let's talk about your superhero powers. Your adeptness at handling life's challenges is truly impressive, facing challenges with a smile. Prepping for those competition exams. You're like my cute ninja 🥷 preparing for a mission. I've got your back, my partner for life. We're in this together. 💪</p>

<p>You've got this hilarious theory that the full moon shines just for you because you're convinced you're the moon's long-lost twin. And you know what? I'm starting to entertain the idea myself. 🌕</p>

<p>I have realized with time that everything feels good at its own time, but you're the one who always gives me that comforting feeling of love and care, even when we have our little disagreements. ❤️</p>

<p>You may tease yourself as a Pentium processor, but in my book, you're more of a next-gen AI—always dishing out hilarious yet spot-on replies and throwing in some life advice along the way like a wise, digital guru. 🤖</p>

<p>Now that I've unlocked the mysteries of love, I understand it's not about counting the days or years we've shared. It's about adoring you more than my irresistible urge for chicken biryani—and believe me, that's a big deal! So here's to loving you more and more, my delightful chicken nugget! 🍗</p>

<p>Happy Valentine’s Day my Love! ❤️</p>

<p>Your Handsome 😊</p>

  <p>My Dearest Anni,</p>
  <p>To the woman who makes every day feel like a celebration, Happy Birthday! 🎉🎈.</p>
  <p>Another year of love and laughter, and here I am, penning down my love for you once again in this letter.</p>
  <p>You know how you believed the moon followed you around wherever you went during your childhood? Well,
    being with you feels just like that to me. You bring so much happiness and magic into my life, just like
    the stars in the night sky.</p>
  <p>Speaking of magic, do you remember that time we joked about giving Hajmola to a shark fish to distract it
    from killing you (Your Sea anxiety)?</p>
  <p>Your sense of humour always makes me laugh, and your creativity never ceases to amaze me. It's these
    little moments that make our bond so unique and special and it forces me to say hmm hmm in our conversation
    (Boring me).</p>
  <p>You know, I cherish every moment we spend together, whether it's talking, laughing, or even being silly
    with earphones around your neck while taking a bath! You bring so much joy and warmth into my life, and I
    am truly grateful for every second we share.</p>
  <p>I must admit, my love, that I can't help but dive into the ocean of your emotions and get lost in its
    endless beauty. You've got me sailing through your heart like a fearless pirate, and I never want to reach
    the shore because your love is my treasure and my destination.</p>
  <p>And as for those who think love is only about appearances, they clearly do not understand the true essence
    of our bond. It's not about faces or fleeting moments; it's about the love in your words, the love in your
    voice, and the love that surrounds us when we're together. How could I ever forget those feelings? They
    are stuck in my heart forever.</p>
  <p>So, my love, as we celebrate your birthday today, I want you to know that you are the most extraordinary
    person I've ever met. You are my moon, my stars, and my everything. With you, life feels like a beautiful
    journey, filled with love and laughter.</p>
  <p>Thank you for being in my life, for being my confidante, my happy world, and my best friend. You mean the
    world to me, and I promise to cherish, adore, and love you with all my heart, today and always.</p>
  <p>Here's to you, my extraordinary Super-Heroine of a partner! Happy Birthday, my love.</p>
  <p>With all my love,</p>

  <p>I love how I sing romantic songs thinking about you.</p>

Hi, Anni my cute,
Aaj Valentine’s Day h… aur normally Mai ye sab manta ni ki agar kisi se love h to usko show karne ke liye kisi ek din ki jarrurat ni hoti… lekin aaj mai tumko kuch baate bolna chhahta hu… lekin care aur love humesa karta hu aur karunga...
Mai jab se baat karna start kiya hu tumse tab se  slowly slowly ye baat mere ko feel hui h… aur aaj iss letter me mai dil ki baat bol raha hu.. aur ye bhi utne ache se ni bata paaunga kuki complete emotions ko koi bhi likh ya bol ni sakta.. wo sirf feel hota h… aur really me mai tumhare liye bahut feelings rakhta hu.. aur mere ko pata h tumhare andar bhi mere liye feelings h lekin express ni kar paati jitna ache se Mai kar pata hu….
Tumko pata h ki mai tumse itna jyada attach ku ho… kuki Tum bahut sweet ho.. ab tum sochogi ahhh sweet to bahut log hote h.. ye ayse hi bol raha h… lekin sabse jyada important ye h ki tum samjhti ho mere ko mere emotions ko meri feelings ko mere thinking ko meri family ko mere nature ko…. Aur phir bhi tum itna attach ho mere se… normally log fake show karte h jisko like karte h unke saamne kuki unko dar hota h ki agar true nature pata chal gaya to like to ni karna band kar denge… aur mai starting se tumhare saamne true hi tha jo karta tha jo sochta tha sab chij.... sayad ye sochta tha ki june me ki kya hi h agar tum mere true nature ko pasand ni karogi to chali jaaogi… lekin mere ko bilkul idea ni tha ki baat karte karte mai tumko itna like karne lagunga aur tum mere ko like karogi thoda hi sahi lekin bahut h mere liye aur ab to mai soch bhi ni pata tumhare bina koi din to kya koi time bhi rahne ka…
Ab to kuch hota h life me mere acha, bura, hasi, dukh kuch bhi to uske hote time hi turant dimag me aata h ki tumko bataunga jab bhi baat hogi tab.. 
kisi ladke ladki ko sath dekhta hu ghumte ya bike pe to lagta h kaash tum hoti mere paas to ayse hi ghumte… Haa Haa sikh lunga mai bike chalana… abhi scooty sa kaam chala lete.. ☺️ 
tum kabhi gussa karti to apni Katrina body se dance karke tumko mana leta… 
tumko bhukh lagti to Zomato se khana mangata.. kuki mera haath ka bana ni kha paaogi na… lekin tumko apne haath se khilata… 
Tum kabhi beemar hoti to tumhara baby ke jyse khyal rakhta..
Tum hasti to mai tumhare saath hast
Tum sad hoti to tumse  baate karke tumhara man halka karta…
Tumko kuch problem hoti to mai solve karta…
Tum mere ko ek baar pyar se dekhti to mai pyar ki barish kar deta….
Inme se kai sara chij to mai distance se bhi kar sakta hu aur wo karne ka try bhi karta hu lekin pata ni hota h ya ni mere se…
Mai tumse har ek chij 100% kar paaunga bolunga to lagega ki ye jyada bol raha h… lekin mai humesa apna best dene ki kosis karta hu tumhare liye… lekin one thing I can guarantee ki tumko humesa khush rakhunga chahe koi bhi situation ho… I known ki tumko lagta h ki meri gf rahi h pahle bhi… lekin mai kisi ke saath itna attach ni tha jitna tumhare saath hu… kisi ke 1 line poem ni likha tha jo tumhare liye itna bada poem likh dala tha… kisi ke liye itna emotions ni aaya jitna tumhare liye aata h… kisi ke dur jaane ka itna jyada dar ni laga jitna tumse dur jaane ka lagta h… kisi ke liye love letter ni likha 1 line aur tumhare liye to I think ye nibandh likh diya hu…
Mujhe tumse baat karna, tumhara care karna, tumko samjhana, tumhari baato ko samjhna, tumhari hasi sunna, tumhara mind maangna, tumhari paglu wali baate, tumhara hmm bolna, jab mai kissi du bolta hu tumhara daatna, jab mai galati karta hu tumhara samjhana, tumhari baate, tumhari cuteness, tumhara care karna bahut bahut bahut acha lagta h… and yes 
I Love you
Aur ye 3 words koi question ni h ki iska answer dena pade tumko… bas I love you and happy Valentine’s day… I hope ki tumhare life ka ye sabse acha 14 Feb rahe ab tak ka… kuki aage har year aur acha hi hote jaayega ☺️😘

Your Kalua,
Akash
